An egg catcher game tests your concentration and the speed of your reflexes as you have to catch eggs falling all around the screen with one basket. To create an egg catcher game you have to design an animation of falling eggs at random positions and a basket will be catching all the falling eggs.


To create an egg catcher game using Python, we need to use three different loops:

One to create new eggs.
Another to check if the catcher has caught an egg.
And the third loop to move eggs and to check if the eggs touched the ground.
